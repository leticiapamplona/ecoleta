## Next Level Week :rocket:
During the first week of June 2020, Rocketseat provided a course to develop a complete application from scratch. In the Starter level project, I dedicated 5 days to the Ecoleta project. To build the application we used knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js and SQLite.

## About :memo:
